    <!-- Domain Knowledge  -->
    <h1>1. Domain Knowledge</h1>
    <p>The following narrative focus on helping people make an informed decision while purchasing a printer.<br>
    To achieve the same, good domain knowledge facilitates better communication. A study on the various factors that determine
    the decision of buying a printer are noted below:<br>

    <h3>Type of Printer</h3>
    <p>The two major types of printers that are ideal for home use are the inkjet printer & a few laser printers.
      There is two sub-categories under the injet printer, depending on the way the ink is stored in the printer. They are cartridge printers and ink tank printers.<br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>
      there are two types of offerings when seen through the lens of functionality namely: monofunctional (Singel Function) & multifuntional.<br>
      The multifuntional printer have an additional feature of scanner, coppier or fax. This saves on buying a separate scanner.
    </p>

    <h3>Speed, Resolution & Colour Cliams</h3>
    <p>
      There are 3 parameters that come into this section, namely: PPM (Prints / Minute), DPI (Dots / Inch), Duty Cycles.<br>
      DPI was a term that had weightage when the printer softwares were relatively primitive. Today, the softwares are able to increase the DPI through software manipulation and thus this KPI is not considered for this analysis.<br>
      Duty Cycle incates how many pages per month can a printer print before it could have a mechanical malfunction. Today's printers have a high Duty cycle for a home use and thus having it in the analysis would be redundant.<br>
      Lastly, PPM could be a KPI to keep in mind as speed in general is always an important parameter when it comes to electronic appliences for a workflow.
    </p>

    <h3>Connectivity</h3>
    <p>
      With the advent of printers which receive printing documnts over the web, the market is laning towards adding new models of the old, by adding wireless featues.
      The different connectivity options we have are: USB, USB+Wi-Fi, USB+Ethenet, Direct Wi-Fi, NFC & SD Card.
    </p>

    <h3>Ink Cost</h3>
    <p>
      A very crucial KPI is the operational cost of the printer and the most important element in this list would be the cost per page. <br>
    </p>

    <h1>2. Hypothesis Creation</h1>
    <p>The next step is to ask question about the main topic and select the main narrative of the process.</p><br>
    <h3>In this case the narrative revolves around how to select the best printer for home use.</h3>

    <h1>3. Data Collection</h1>
    <p>An attempt to find an available data-set was made which failed. The next step was to manually collect all the data from ecommerce websites.
      <br>For this analysis, I collected data from Amazon.in and a few specification details from the company websites of the printers</p><br>
